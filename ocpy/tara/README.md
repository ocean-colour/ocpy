## Data model

ap_n is the number of raw ap samples collected by the ACs that are in each bin. These are typically 1 min bins and the ACs collects at 4Hz so ~240 in each bin but some are thrown out based on QA/QC. (edited) 


Then ap676_lh is the line hight of the chla absorption peak used to estimate the chla concentration just based on a simple empirical relationship. This is based on https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211122013000467 and you can see this calculated in the code here https://github.com/OceanOptics/InLineAnalysis/blob/63a92bc3eed1ba1dab607f121f26b2196900df60/lib/processACS.m#L613. That processACS.m file has most of the details on these but frankly it isn't very user friendly. We've been searching for funding to do a coding sprint to move this whole repo to python and make it more modular. (edited)
