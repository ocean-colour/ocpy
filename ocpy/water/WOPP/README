Running the programme:
	Simply doubleclick on on WOPP_gui.py (Windows)
	or type 'WOPP_gui.py' at the command prompt (Linux).
	The 'WOPP.py' programme can also run standalone; 
	this requires some basic knowledge of the python language.
Note: before saving an IOP, it must be plottet on the canvas.

Installation of python(requires administrator rights):
	This programme requires the free available python programming language
